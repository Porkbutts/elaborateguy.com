Conventional financial advice tells us to live below our means, spend less than we earn, and save and invest what we can. 401k plans and IRAs or Individual Retirement Accounts are two of the most common retirement investment vehicles, yet many people do not understand the basics of how these accounts work and the advantages they provide.

## Retirement accounts are tax-sheltered accounts

Both the 401k plan and the IRA are types of retirement accounts which have special tax advantages. Other plans such as the 529 College Savings Plan, and HSA or Health Savings Account hold similar tax shelter advantages. Each of these accounts typically only allows withdrawals related to the purpose of the plan, e.g. retirement, college, or medical related expenses, although there are exceptions. 

The diagram below illustrates how retirement accounts are one of several types of tax-sheltered vehicles.

This article will be focusing primarily on 401ks and IRAs which share many similarities.


## Differences between the 401k and IRA
A 401k is an account that is sponsored by your employer, meaning you're typically only eligible for a 401k account if you are employed and your employer has a 401k plan that you can enroll in. 

An IRA on the other hand is an account you can open up by yourself at most financial institutions.

With a 401k, many employers offer *contribution matching*, meaning that for every dollar you contribute to your 401k account, your employer will match that value up to a maximum amount, usually 3-6% of your paycheck.

For example, if your employer matches up to 3% of your paycheck, and you make $2000 each paycheck and contribute 10% of your salary to your 401k, then you would be contributing $200 to your account each paycheck, and your employer would be contributing an additional $60.

With a 401k, your make contributions through paycheck deductions, but with an IRA you would simply transfer money into the account to make a contribution.

## Investment Options
Once you've contributed money to the account, the next step is to invest those funds.

With a 401k plan, your investment options are somewhat limited which should make it an easier choice.
