Conventional financial advice tells us to live below our means, spend less than we earn, and save and invest what we can. 401k plans and IRAs, or Individual Retirement Accounts, are the most commonly suggested retirement investment vehicles for this purpose, yet many people do not take advantage of them or understand the tax benefits that they provide.

In this article I'll explain the basics of the 401k and IRA, similarities and differences, and how to make the most out of their tax benefits.

## Retirement accounts as tax-sheltered accounts

Both the 401k plan and the IRA are types of retirement accounts that have special tax advantages. There are other plans with similar tax benefits that are not related to retirement savings, such as the 529 College Savings Plan, and HSA, or Health Savings Account. All of these accounts are tax-advantaged, but have different criteria for what qualifies as an eligible withdrawal, or distribution.

The diagram below illustrates how retirement accounts are just one of several types of tax-sheltered vehicles.

In this article, we will be focusing primarily on the 401k and IRA which are retirement investment accounts that share many of the same tax benefits and rules.

Let's start with the differences.

## Differences between the 401k and IRA

A 401k is an account that is sponsored by your employer, meaning you're typically only eligible for a 401k account if you are employed and your employer has a 401k plan that you can enroll in. 

An IRA on the other hand is an account you can open up by yourself at most financial institutions.

### 401k Contribution Matching

With a 401k, many employers offer *contribution matching*, meaning that for every dollar you contribute to your 401k account, your employer will match that value up to a maximum amount, usually 3-6% of your paycheck.

As an example, suppose you make $2000 each paycheck and contribute 10% of your salary to your 401k. This would result in a contribution of $200 toward your 401k each paycheck. If your employer match is 3%, then you would receive the full match of **$60 = 0.03 * 2000** since you are contributing more than 3% each paycheck.

Another difference between 401ks and IRAs is that with a 401k you make contributions through paycheck deductions, but with an IRA you can transfer money anytime you want.

## Pre-tax (Traditional) vs Roth

### Pre-tax
401ks are typically pre-tax, also known as traditional, meaning that any money you contribute is not counted as part of your taxable income. Here's how it works.

Let's suppose that in 2020 your total wages were $100,000 before taxes and that you contributed $10,000 to your 401k. Your taxable income would only be $90,000 based on your wages.

Your money is also allowed to grow tax free meaning that if you sell and buy investments within your 401k account, you will not trigger any capital gains taxes. Unfortunately this also means you won't be able to claim any capital losses from selling investments in your account.

So what's the catch? While your contributions are tax deductible, and earnings are tax free, when you eventually withdraw from this account during retirement, the distribution, or withdrawal, will be counted as taxable income. 


### Roth

### Contribution Limits

## Investment Options
Once you've contributed money to the account, the next step is to invest those funds.

With a 401k plan, your investment options are somewhat limited which should make it an easier choice. For those who want an easy "set it and forget it" option, I recommend **Target Date Funds** which are common in 401k accounts.

### Target Date Funds

A target date fund has an associated year which is your estimated retirement year. What a target date fund does essentially, is start out with a relatively aggressive growth strategy, which then scales more conservatively as the years go on.

The idea is that when you have a long time until retirement, you can probably handle more volatility and risk in exchange for more growth potential, since you probably won't need the funds in your 401k immediately, and can stand to ride out any market downturns which could last up to several years.

As you approach your retirement date, you would care less about aggressively growing your investment account, and more about generating consistent fixed income from your retirement nest egg.
