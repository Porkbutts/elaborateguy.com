During the Covid-19 pandemic, certain industries have been hit harder than others. Many companies in the retail, airline, oil and banking industries are all down more than 50% from their 2020 highs in February. But while the Covid-19 virus has wreaked havoc on some industries, others such as cloud software and biopharma are thriving more than ever.

As a software developer, I am seeing first-hand how my company has not only been insulated from the economic damage of the pandemic, but is actually thriving during this tumultuous time. Many of the SaaS (Software-as-a-service) platforms that our company uses are more popular than ever. Businesses have been forced to undergo rapid digital transformation in order to adapt to the current state of the world. and because of that there is huge potential for growth in many of these cloud software companies.

## Not all tech companies alike
Some tech companies offer services directly to individual consumers, while others offer services to businesses (B2B). Some companies provide services to both businesses and individuals.

Tech companies can offer services directly to consumers like Uber, Lyft, Etsy, Roku, but there are tech companies that offer services to businesses (B2B) such as Shopify, Zoom, Datadog, Fastly, Twilio. There has been real money made on these B2B software companies.

## Are we in a bubble?
No not yet. I would say this has just accelerated growth that we should have seen over 5 or 10 years and we will be seeing that rate of growth into 2020 and 2021.
