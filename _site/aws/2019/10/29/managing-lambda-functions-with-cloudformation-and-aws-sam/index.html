  <p>It’s easy and convenient to get started with AWS Lambda by using the Console, but trying to manage multiple lambda functions via the in-browser editor for larger projects comes with its own set of limitations. Here are a few reasons why it’s not advised to work exclusively in the in-browser editor.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The browser could timeout while updating code and progress is lost.</li>
  <li>Lack of version control tooling like Git.</li>
  <li>Limits on deployment package size.</li>
  <li>Unable to install external package dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an ideal environment, we develop and test our code locally and when we’re ready we can package and deploy our code to AWS Lambda.</p>

<p>In order to get around these limitations, we’ll learn how to manage and deploy lambda functions using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html">AWS Serverless Application Model</a> or <em>AWS SAM</em> for short.</p>

<p>Before we get started, this article assumes you already have some familiarity with the AWS CLI and understand the basics of Lambda functions. If not, check out my posts on <a href="/aws/2019/10/10/getting-started-with-the-aws-cli/">Getting started with the AWS CLI</a> and <a href="/aws/2019/10/20/getting-started-with-aws-lambda/">Getting started with AWS Lambda</a>.</p>
